<h1 font-size="24px"><b>BinaryConversionsGUI</b> | Computer Organization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p font-size="16px">This project is a <b>Binary Conversions</b> helper for my Computer Organization class.</p>
<p font-size="16px">The main purpose of this project was to help me visualize the conversions and find a new way of thinking of them.</p>
<p font-size="16px">I wanted to have the code convert the numbers in a similar way to how you would do it in your head.</p>
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p font-size="16px">I plan on revamping the conversion calculations and using bitwise math to convert instead.</p>
<p font-size="16px">This may be in a new project that I can use as a library for Binary Conversions.</p>
